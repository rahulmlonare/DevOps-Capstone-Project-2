Following are the specifications of life-cycle: 
1. Git workflow should be implemented. Since the company follows 
monolithic architecture of Development you need to take care of version 
control. The release should happen only on 25th of every month. 
2. Code build should be triggered once the commits are made in the master
Branch.
3. The code should be containerized with the help of the Docker file, The 
Dockerfile should be built every time if there is a push to Git-Hub. Create 
a custom Docker image using a Dockerfile. 
4. As per the requirement in the production server, you need to use the 
Kubernetes cluster and the containerized code from Docker hub should be 
deployed with 2 replicas. Create a NodePort service and configure the 
same for port 30008.
5. Create a Jenkins pipeline script to accomplish the above task.
6. For configuration management of the infrastructure, you need to deploy 
the configuration on the servers to install necessary software and 
configurations.
7. Using Terraform accomplish the task of infrastructure creation in the 
AWS cloud provider.
